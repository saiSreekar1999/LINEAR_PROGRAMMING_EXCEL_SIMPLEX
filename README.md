# LINEAR_PROGRAMMING_EXCEL_SIMPLEX
This case study involved a sophisticated application of Linear Programming (LP) to solve an optimization problem, where the objective was to maximize a specific value. Using the SIMPLEX algorithm, a well-established method for solving LP problems, the study first entailed constructing a mathematical formulation. This formulation clearly defined the decision variables, constraints, and the objective function that needed to be maximized. Through careful consideration and application of various statistical parameters—including F-statistic and p-values—the model's integrity was ensured by eliminating any multicollinearity, which could skew the results and lead to unreliable conclusions.

The SIMPLEX solver was then employed to navigate through the feasible region defined by the constraints systematically. This approach ensured that the maximum value of the objective function was located, which is essential for making informed decisions based on the model. Throughout the process, particular attention was paid to the statistical significance of the variables involved, ensuring that only the most impactful factors were included in the final model. The optimized model that emerged from this comprehensive approach provided clear insights into the problem at hand, with a solid foundation of both mathematical theory and statistical analysis supporting the results.

This careful blend of mathematical programming and statistical analysis demonstrates a robust approach to solving complex optimization problems, leading to actionable solutions and strategic decision-making.
